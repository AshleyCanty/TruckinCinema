# TruckinCinema _(in progress)_
Another Truckin' Cinema is proud to present their mobile app to the world. Drive-in theater lovers will now be able to RSVP for movies, order food for delivery or pickup, and join the ATC membership for weekly promotional benefits!

_Delsea Drive-in Theater is not associated with this application. This project for the sole purpose of demonstrating my skills as a developer._

You'll have to plug in your API Keys if you want give it a test run. When you open Xcode and see the file navigator, just go to Supporting Files -> API-Info.plist and add your API Keys.

### Wireframes
I became acquainted with Figma after taking a UI/UX course on Coursera. It was part of Meta's iOS Developer Professional Certificate program, which I'm still in the process of completing. I spent 1 week on the wireframe and revamped the design twice before deciding to use AMC's layout along with [this movie app design](https://ui8.net/enver-studio-ffdda4/products/cinemax---movie-apps-ui-kits) that I found on ui8.com. I really like Figma and found the wireframing process to be quite fun. I was really excited to start bringing it all to life as soon as possible.

### Backstory
The "drive-in theater" concept was inspired by the Delsea Drive-In Theater, which is the ONLY drive-in theater in the State of New Jersey by the way. I wanted to build something that was based on what I enjoy, which are movies and the great outdoors ðŸŽ¥ðŸŒ³. A few years ago, I took a road trip to visit the Delsea Drive-In Theater for the first time. Jurassic Park was the movie I went to see and I thought it was very a neat experience. Over the course of every weekend, the theater only shows 4 movies. The movies are split between just two screens in their own seperate partking lots. I recall that the check-in line was quite long, and ordering food from the snackbar took awhile too. These experiences are what encouraged me to build this particular project. The begging question was, "What if people were able to RSVP and order snacks ahead of time?" and so now, here we are with "Another Truckin' Cinema".
