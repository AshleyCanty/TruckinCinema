Another Truckin' Cinema is proud to present their mobile app to the world. Drive-in theater lovers will now be able to RSVP for movies, order food for delivery or pickup, and join the ATC membership for weekly promotional benefits!

*spsssst* Hey, this project was inspired by AMC's mobile app as well as the Deslea Drive-In Theater (which is the ONLY drive-in theater in the State of New Jersey btw). I wanted to build something that was based on what I enjoy...and I absolutely enjoy watching movies! A few years ago, I visited the Delsea Drive-In Theater to see Jurassic Park and thought it was very a neat experience. Every weekend, they show only 4 movies, which end up being split between just two screens. I recall that the line to check-in was quite long, and ordering food from the snackbar took awhile too. These experiences are what encouraged me to build this particular project as I was brainstorming what to add to my portfolio next. The begging question was, "What if people were able to RSVP and order snacks ahead of time?"...and the rest was history.
